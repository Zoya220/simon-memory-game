## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a fully functional, browser-based implementation of the classic electronic memory game "Simon." 
The objective is to watch the sequence of colors and repeat it by clicking the buttons in the correct order. 
The sequence gets longer with each successful level. 
The game was built to practice and demonstrate core JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and game state management.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Random Sequence Generation:** The game generates a new, random color to add to the sequence at each level.
* **Level Progression:** The game starts at Level 1 and advances each time the user correctly completes the sequence.
* **High Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of the highest level reached and displays it upon game over.
* **Interactive UI:** Buttons provide visual feedback by "flashing" when clicked or as part of the game's sequence.
* **Game State Management:** Clear start, play, and game-over states are managed with JavaScript.
* **Start & Quit Controls:** Users can start a new game or quit the current game at any time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the game.
* **CSS3:** For styling the game board, buttons, and visual effects like the flash animation.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** For all game logic, including event handling, sequence generation, user input checking, and DOM manipulation.
